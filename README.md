WebRTC Media Server

Documentation comming soon, major refactoring ongoing. Stay tunned!

## Usage
This repository is currently a host for the base media code used in different projects. While it may take a while to propertly encapsulate it and define reusable components to create a propper SDK, you can use the following native wrappers:
 - [Media Server for Node.js](https://github.com/medooze/media-server-node)
 - Media Server for Java (Comming soon)
